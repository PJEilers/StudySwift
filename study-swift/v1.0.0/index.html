                Hi there! <br>We are StudySwift and we are here
                to help you study even faster than before. We are doing this by
                enabling you to quickly summarize whatever you are reading.
                The idea is simple, you copy a piece of text to the field on the left
                and start reading. As soon as you pass a sentence you want to save just click on it.
                We'll save this sentence in the box at the right, which will be your summary.
